# Computer Vision 
In recent years, we've see an extra-ordinary growth in Computer Vision, with applications in face recognition, image understanding, search, drones, mapping, semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles(we shoud ask more about this Elon Musk :wink:). A key part to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification, object detection and image similarity.
