# Background and Basics</br>

## What are Channels and Kernels

## Why should we (nearly) always use 3x3 kernels?</br>

## How many times do we need to perform 3x3 convolution operation to reach 1x1 from 199x199 (show calculations)</br>

## How are kernels initialized?</br>

## What happens during the training of a DNN?</br>
