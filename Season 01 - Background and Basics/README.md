# Background and Basics</br>

### What are Channels and Kernels</br>
Channels come from "media". Looking at broadcast technology behind TVs you have mulitple channels for different information that gets broadcasted to your TV. Let's assume that we are talking about 2D convolutions applied on images.</br>/n
	In a grayscale image, the data is a matrix of dimensions __w x h__, 
	

### Why should we (nearly) always use 3x3 kernels?</br>

### How many times do we need to perform 3x3 convolution operation to reach 1x1 from 199x199 (show calculations)</br>

### How are kernels initialized?</br>

### What happens during the training of a DNN?</br>
